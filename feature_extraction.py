# Code based on  implementing feature extraction based on the distinction between
# recursivity and specificity.
#  - Recursivity is the ability to apply a process to a dataset and then apply the
#    same process to the result.
#  - Specificity is the ability to apply a process to a dataset and then apply a
#    different process to the result.
#  - Recursivity and specificity are two orthogonal dimensions.

# Same same, but different.

#
# Define the recursive process and specific filter for feature extraction
# In this example, the recursive_process and specific_filter functions are defined
# to apply a recursive process and filter specific features from the data. These functions
# are then passed to the set_recursive_process and set_specific_filter methods of the
# FeatureExtractor instance to set the recursive process and specific filter for feature
# extraction. Finally, the extract_features method is called to apply the recursive process
# and specific filter to the dataset and extract the features from the data.
#
# This example demonstrates how the FeatureExtractor class can be used to implement feature extraction based on the distinction between recursivity and specificity. By using this class, you can easily define and apply different recursive processes and specific filters to extract features from a dataset, without having to implement the feature extraction process from scratch each time.

# Create a FeatureExtractor instance

# Set the recursive process and specific filter
